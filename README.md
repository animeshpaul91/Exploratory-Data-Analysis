Exploratory Data Analysis using CDC and Twitter Data


DIC Lab1 Readme:
The Entire Zip contains individual parts in 3 directories:
1. Part 1
2. Part 2
3. Part 3

Each part has a separate Jupyter Notebook File (.ipynb). Please run all the cells in each part sequentially to avoid potential errors. 
The third part already contains Tweets data in a csv named Tweets.csv. Please do not run the code to recollect tweets. Sufficient tweets have already been collected. 
This part also contains the shiny app and its code.
